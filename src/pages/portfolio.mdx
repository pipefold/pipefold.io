## BuildX

A prototype WikiHouse design tool that enables collaborative design and planning of modular housing systems.

*Built at [Open Systems Lab](https://opensystemslab.io).*

## Atlas of Ownership

An open map of property rights and obligations across time and space, visualizing land ownership patterns and their historical context.

*Built at [Open Systems Lab](https://opensystemslab.io).*

## tsl-lib

An in‑progress library of modular TSL (Three.js Shading Language) nodes and patterns for composing expressive, high‑performance graphics in the browser. The aim is to make creative pipelines feel intuitive by packaging clean building blocks—raymarching and volume rendering primitives, geometry morphing, and compute‑driven workflows—that can be mixed and tuned.

*Part of Pipe Fold R&D.*

Current focus: volumetric rendering of a 256×256×109 CT head (AIP/MIP/isosurface) with displacement effects, migrating to WebGPU compute for performance. In parallel, prototyping 3D spectrograms and real‑time volatility surfaces—all built from the same composable node toolkit.

*Most experiments target WebGPU.*
