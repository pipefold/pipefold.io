## Professional Projects

Highlighting client and employer work where I've delivered production-grade solutions.

### Open Systems Lab

[Open Systems Lab](https://opensystemslab.io) is a research and development company focused on creating open, accessible tools for understanding complex systems and building more sustainable futures.

#### BuildX

A prototype WikiHouse design tool that enables collaborative design and planning of modular housing systems.

## Personal Projects &amp; Demos
Open-source experiments and utilities I've built to explore cutting-edge tech like shaders and WebGPU. These showcase my hands-on skills in creative coding.

### TSL Patterns Library
A library of reusable Three.js Shader Language (TSL) patterns for efficient, vibe-driven 3D effects. Includes raymarching examples with compute textures. [View on GitHub ↗](https://github.com/pipefold/tsl-lib) | [npm package ↗](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsl-lib)

{/* Ideas &amp; Concepts card */}
<div class="portfolio-card">
## Ideas &amp; Concepts
Backburner explorations and innovative ideas I'm prototyping or planning. These highlight my interest in emerging tech like p2p systems and GPU computing—open to collaborations!

### Nostr Semantic Matching
A decentralized app using Nostr protocol with semantic search (e.g., via embeddings) to connect users based on shared interests/ideas. Could evolve into a "semantic social network." Status: Concept stage; prototyping semantic matching logic.

### Mumax3 on WebGPU
Porting the Mumax3 micromagnetic simulator to WebGPU for browser-based simulations. Untapped potential for accessible scientific computing—no native installs needed. Status: Research phase; exploring WebGPU compute shaders.
