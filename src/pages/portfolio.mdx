## Professional Projects

Highlighting client and employer work where I've delivered production-grade solutions.

### Open Systems Lab

[Open Systems Lab](https://opensystemslab.io) is a research and development company focused on creating open, accessible tools for understanding complex systems and building more sustainable futures.

#### BuildX

A prototype WikiHouse design tool that enables collaborative design and planning of modular housing systems.

- [Backend Source ↗](https://github.com/opensystemslab/buildx-api)
- [Demo Video ↗](https://youtube.com/watch?v=buildx-demo)

#### Atlas of Ownership

An open map of property rights and obligations across time and space, visualizing land ownership patterns and their historical context.

## Other Projects
Open-source experiments, demos, and concept work.

### TSL Patterns Library
A library of reusable Three.js Shader Language (TSL) patterns for efficient, vibe-driven 3D effects. Includes raymarching examples with compute textures. [View on GitHub ↗](https://github.com/pipefold/tsl-lib) | [npm package ↗](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsl-lib)

### Nostr Semantic Matching
A decentralized app using Nostr protocol with semantic search (e.g., via embeddings) to connect users based on shared interests/ideas. Could evolve into a "semantic social network." Status: Concept stage; prototyping semantic matching logic.

### Mumax3 on WebGPU
Porting the Mumax3 micromagnetic simulator to WebGPU for browser-based simulations. Untapped potential for accessible scientific computing—no native installs needed. Status: Research phase; exploring WebGPU compute shaders.
